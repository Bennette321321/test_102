# **Final Project: FPGA Image Display from MicroSD on Basys 3**

## **Project Overview**

In this final project, students will implement an FPGA-based image display system that reads image data from a microSD card and renders it on a VGA display using a Basys 3 board. The primary objective is to successfully interface an FPGA with a microSD card, extract stored images, and display them on the VGA output.

## **Project Requirements**

1. **MicroSD Card Data Retrieval**: The FPGA must be capable of reading data from a microSD card. Data may be stored in a raw format or within a file system (such as FAT32).  
2. **VGA Display Implementation**: The FPGA should be able to generate VGA signals and display content on a monitor.  
3. **Image Rendering**: Successfully retrieve and display an image stored in the microSD card on the VGA screen with resolution of 320 \* 240 pixel.  
4. **Image Switching**: Implement a method to switch between multiple stored images.  
5. **Extra Features**: Add an additional functionality to enhance the project (e.g., image blending, animations, file system support, etc.).

## **Deliverables**

* **Verilog Code**: Well-documented HDL implementation.  
* **Project Report**: Explanation of design decisions, implementation details, and challenges faced.  
* **Demo**: A live demonstration or recorded video showcasing project functionality.
